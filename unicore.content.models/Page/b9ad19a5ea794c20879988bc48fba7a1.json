  "content": "Your baby is much stronger now. She might be able to hold up her head for a\nfew seconds. She can now focus better with her eyes and her vision is\nimproving. You might see your baby looking at her own hands. She is starting\nto understand that it is her hand and she can use it. Soon she will reach out\nto grasp things. She also listens better, and understands where sounds come\nfrom. You may see her turn her head toward sounds. About now, you will notice\nyour baby stays awake longer in the daytime, and has definite times when she\nwants to play. She is beginning to know night from day. Soon, she will begin\nto love stretching her arms and legs. Give your baby enough space to stretch.\nLay a blanket on the floor and let her move around on it. This helps to\nstrengthen her growing muscles. If she is lying on her belly, she may start to\npush off with her legs. She\u2019s on her way to moving around! You may think your\nbaby is too young to sing or talk to, but it is a good idea if you do. Hearing\nyou sing or talk to her will help her learn to talk. If she looks the other\nway or loses interest while you are singing or talking to her, just try\nsomething else or give her time to rest. created by BabyCentre\n\n",
