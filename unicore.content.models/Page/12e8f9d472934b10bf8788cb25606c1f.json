  "content": "Now your baby Is about the size of your hand. He is growing, and developing\nall his senses. When he is born he will be able to see, taste, smell and hear.\nThe circle of darker skin around your nipples will be getting larger as your\nbreasts grow. This helps your baby to find the breast once he is born and\nmakes it easier for him to latch on and get milk. You may find your breasts\ngrow quite quickly and feel much heavier. Your skin may be changing as well.\nDark patches of skin may develop on your face. Or you may get a dark line down\nyour tummy. These can be made worse by being out in the sun, so cover your\nskin and head, or stay in the shade. They will fade after your baby is born.\nPregnancy makes the joints in your body looser. So you may find you get aches\nand pains when you carry something heavy. Take care when lifting things.\nDivide heavy shopping into smaller loads. You may need more rest as well. Try\nto rest each afternoon and go to bed early if you are feeling tired. Growing a\nbaby is hard work! created by BabyCenter\n\n",
