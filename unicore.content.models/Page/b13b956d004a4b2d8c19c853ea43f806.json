But you can prevent it being passed to your baby with the right care during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIf you have not been tested for HIV yet, you may be able to get tested at a health facility. Only you will know the results, but you could take a friend with you for support.\r\n\r\nIf your first HIV test was negative you will be offered another test later in pregnancy. Please take it if you can. You can avoid passing HIV to your baby with the right care.\r\n\r\nIt can be scary to find out you have HIV. Give yourself time to get used to it. No one can see it and lots of pregnant women are living with it. Medicine will help to prevent transmission of HIV to your baby. Some health facilities offer this medicine free. This medicine is offered in government and faith-based health facilities.\r\n\r\nYou can lead a normal life if you take all your medicines and look after yourself. \r\n\r\n",
