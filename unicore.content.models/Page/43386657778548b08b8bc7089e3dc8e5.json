  "content": "Your baby is getting more flexible. He may enjoy opening and closing his\nfingers, or clapping his hands. Your baby's sense of humour is developing,\ntoo. A tickle or a noisy kiss on his tummy is likely to make him chuckle.\nRight from birth, your baby loves to be touched. It's important for his growth\nand development. About now, different textures will start to interest your\nbaby As he starts to understand the world, just playing helps your baby's\nbrain to grow. As his brain develops, he is getting more curious. He may play\nwith a small toy that he can hold and shake about. He will be learning about\ncolour, shape and size, too. He also learns from the noise a toy makes and\nfrom feeling if it is soft or hard. At this age, if he is on his belly, he may\nlift up his head and shoulders, using his arms for support. Your baby may even\nbe able to roll over from his front to his back. Encourage him by jiggling a\ntoy on the side he usually rolls to. Clap and smile when he does! created by\nBabyCentre\n\n",
