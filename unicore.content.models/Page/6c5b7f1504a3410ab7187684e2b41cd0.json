  "content": "At the hospital my baby did not cry much. It started when we got home. She\ncried right through that first night. I was breastfeeding her fine, I had no\nproblem with that. I knew which positions to use. The nurses had shown me at\nthe clinic. But she just cried all night, every night. She would sleep all day\nand cry all night. I came to fear the nights. She screamed like she was in\npain. I couldn\u2019t leave her alone. I sat with her all night. It would tear my\nheart apart. I thought I would go mad from lack of sleep. Other moms tell me I\nshould have done things differently. I should have kept her awake during the\nday to make her more tired at night. Or I should have just left her to cry.\nBut I was 18 at the time and all I just did the best I could. Then when she\nreached 6 months, the crying stopped. That was the first time I started to\nenjoy being a mother! She turns 2 this year and she is doing well! And I am\ndoing well. The early days were hard. But we both got through it all okay!\n**MAMA HELP: Every baby is different but all babies cry. Listening to your\nbaby cry for hours can make you worried, even angry. You may not be able to\nstop him from crying. But remain calm and do your best to soothe him until he\nsettles down. If you know he is not hungry, tired, wet or in pain, get a\nsecond opinion from someone you trust. Together you can decide if your baby\nneeds to see a doctor.**\n\n",
