  "content": "Created by Baby Center\r\n\r\nInside your womb, your baby wakes and sleeps at regular intervals now. He can\r\nnow open and close his eyes, and suck his finger or thumb! This helps develop\r\nhis sucking muscles so that he is strong enough to feed as soon as he is born.\r\nHis brain is growing and developing quickly now. He can respond to sound now.\r\nAt first, he will only hear sounds from your body, like your heartbeat. But\r\nslowly he will start to hear noises from outside your body. Sing to your baby\r\nso he can hear your voice. It may feel like your womb is up near your ribcage,\r\nwhich will make you feel out of breath. Eating can be difficult because your\r\nstomach may be squeezed by your growing baby. Have small meals more often and\r\nsnacks between meals. As your baby grows so does your womb. The skin over your\r\nbelly stretches and this can itch. You may notice red streaks on your tummy,\r\nhips, bottom and breasts. They are stretch marks and they will fade to faint\r\nmarks after you give birth. You may have leg cramps or swollen veins. Your\r\nbreasts are fuller and heavier now. This is because they are getting ready to\r\nmake milk for your baby.\r\n\r\n",
