  "content": "Created by Baby Center\r\n\r\nYour newborn is new to this big, noisy world! You can see he moves in a jerky\r\nway as he gets used to it. Soon, his movements will be smoother. You may worry\r\nyour baby isn't getting enough milk. If your baby is feeding every 2 to 3\r\nhours, or at least 8 times a day, then that is enough. The colour of your\r\nbaby's stools is a good way to check. They are black at first and turn yellow\r\nby day 4. At about 2 weeks, your baby is sucking, grasping, blinking and\r\nrooting for your nipple. Sometimes he will look straight into your eyes. It is\r\ngood to respond by looking back and smiling and nodding. He is learning fast!\r\nWatch for your baby trying to lift his head when he's lying on his belly. This\r\nis a way for him to get stronger. He might turn his head from side to side. As\r\nhe approaches 1 month old, your baby begins to lose his newborn quiver and\r\njumpiness. He is growing stronger every day and learning about the world\r\naround him. He might stare at you now. One exciting change is he's beginning\r\nto make baby noises. This is his way of talking to you! Try to make baby\r\nnoises back. Keep talking even when you put him down and move away. \r\n",
